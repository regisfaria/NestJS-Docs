# NestJS Documentation

## Overview

While I was working I got a request to create a documentation on NestJS APIs

This repository is born out of that request, hosting the code I've created while learning how to use **swagger** with **nestjs**.

All endpoints were created using NestJS command: `nest g resource <resource_name>`

## Installation & Running

You will need the latest LTS version of **Node** and **NPM**, then run:

`> npm install`

After that you will be able to run the API with:

`> npm run start:dev`

And the documentation will be available at: **http://localhost:3000/docs**
